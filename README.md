## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- Uses a **multi-stage amplifier circuit** with BC547 transistors to amplify weak EM signals near live AC wires.
- **RC-coupling** is used between stages to improve gain.
- A **grounded emitter** configuration ensures stable amplification.
- The LED indicator glows when the probe is near an active AC wire, confirming live voltage presence.
